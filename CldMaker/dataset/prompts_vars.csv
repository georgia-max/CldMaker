13,"Car production builds the inventory of cars at the dealer. A hgiher inventory leads to a lower market price, and lower market prices cause less car production in the future. There is only one negative arrow in the producution loop, so we know that this is negative feedback. This loop describes the effect of the supply curve from your study of ecomomics. If the price were to increase, the retail sale of cars would tend to fall. Retails sales drain the inventory of cars held in stock at the dealership.
