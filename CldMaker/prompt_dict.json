If work pressure is high, the student may choose to cut corners, skim some reading, skip classes, or give less complete answers to the questions in assignments. For example, if a student works 50 hours per week and can do one task per hour with high quality but only does half the work each assignment requires for a good job, then the completion rate would be (50)(1)(.5) = 25 task equivalents per week.\n\nWork Pressure determines the workweek and effort devoted to assignments. Work pressure depends on the assignment backlog and the Time Remaining to complete the work: The bigger the backlog or the less time remaining, the higher the workweek needs to be to complete the work on time. Time remaining is of course simply the difference between the Due Date and the current Calendar Time. The two most basic options available to a student faced with high work pressure are to (1) work longer hours, thus increasing the completion rate and reducing the backlog (the Midnight Oil loop B l), or (2) work faster by spending less time on each task, speeding the completion rate and reducing the backlog (the Corner Cutting loop B2).
